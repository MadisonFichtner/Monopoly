1) The only dependency of our monopoly program is JavaFX, which was used to create our GUI

2) To run monopoly from the command line:
	1. Open command line
	2. Navigate to where the monopoly.jar file was saved
	3. Type "java -jar monopoly.jar" into the command line
	4. Enter game mode (english or msu) and the users names
	5. Enjoy a game of monopoly
	
3) The only missing component from our program is the timeout. Everything else is fully functional, and looks exceptional.
