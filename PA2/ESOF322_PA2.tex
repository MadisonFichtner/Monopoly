	The player rolls dice & \\
	&The system returns the dice as an length 2 array \\
	The player moves that many spaces forward on the board &\\
	&If the player passed the GO space, they are credited \$200.00 \\
	&The system takes actions based on the space the player landed on \\

	Steps: &  }{The user attempts to build a house &\\
	&The server checks if all properties of the color are owned \\

	&The system checks if there are four houses on the street \\
	&If there are, the system checks if the number of hotels is maxed,  \\
